## Current Issue: #148 - Define Clear Stream Design Patterns for EventCore

This work log tracks the mob programming session where each expert agent contributes their specialized knowledge to implement the stream design patterns.

## Current Status
- Reviewing open issues to select next task
- Found several high-priority issues related to event sourcing and type-driven development

## Issue Analysis

### High Priority Issues:
1. **#148 - Define Clear Stream Design Patterns for EventCore** - HIGH priority, event-sourcing architecture
2. **#146 - Implement DORA Metrics and Engineering Effectiveness Tracking** - HIGH priority, engineering effectiveness
3. **#145 - Implement Comprehensive Event Sourcing Test Infrastructure** - HIGH priority, testing infrastructure
4. **#144 - Refactor Mutable State Transitions to Pure Functions** - HIGH priority, functional programming

### Other Important Issues:
- #155 - Release v0.2.1 (appears to be a PR, not an issue)
- #126 - Implement true streaming size limits (MEDIUM priority, technical debt)
- Several post-MVP issues (#86-89)

## Initial Discussion

**Teresa Torres**: Looking at the high-priority issues, we should focus on outcomes that unblock the team's ability to deliver value. The stream design patterns (#148) seem foundational - without clear patterns, the team will struggle with consistency.

**Alberto Brandolini**: I agree. Issue #148 is about defining the event streams which is core to the domain model. EventCore's approach of dynamic consistency boundaries aligns well with event storming principles. We should tackle this first.

**Greg Young**: The stream design patterns are indeed fundamental. EventCore's multi-stream atomic operations are a powerful evolution of traditional aggregates. Getting this right will make everything else easier.

**Edwin Brady**: From a type-driven perspective, #148 provides the foundation for encoding domain rules in types. Once we have clear stream patterns, we can ensure illegal states are unrepresentable.

**Niko Matsakis**: The Rust type system can enforce these patterns at compile time. EventCore's use of phantom types and derive macros is excellent for type safety.

**Michael Feathers**: While I appreciate the importance of #148, we also need the test infrastructure (#145) to verify our implementations. Perhaps we could work on both in parallel?

**Kent Beck**: I suggest we start with #148 but write tests as we go. TDD applies to architecture decisions too - we should have tests that verify our stream patterns work correctly.

**Rich Hickey**: The functional refactoring (#144) would simplify everything, but I agree the stream patterns come first. Once we have immutable events flowing through well-defined streams, the functional patterns follow naturally.

**Nicole Forsgren**: From an engineering effectiveness standpoint, #146 (DORA metrics) would help the team measure their improvement, but I agree the foundational work should come first.

## Team Decision

After discussion, the team consensus is to work on **Issue #148: Define Clear Stream Design Patterns for EventCore** as it provides the foundation for all other event-sourcing work.

## Round 1 - Teresa Torres (Product Discovery Coach)

I'll start by defining the outcomes we're trying to achieve with this stream design work. The key outcome is enabling developers to confidently implement event-sourced features without confusion about stream boundaries or naming conventions.

I've created a todo list that focuses on delivering this outcome incrementally, starting with tests (TDD approach), then implementation, and finally documentation. The list includes commit and PR steps to ensure we follow the team's workflow.

Now let me hand off to Kent Beck to start with the first test task.

## Round 2 - Kent Beck (TDD Coach)

Looking at our first todo item, I need to write failing tests for stream naming convention functions. I've created a test file at `tests/stream_naming_tests.rs` with comprehensive tests for the stream naming conventions.

The tests are failing as expected with compilation errors because:
1. The `streams` module doesn't exist yet in the domain
2. Some type imports need adjustment (SessionId exists but in a different location)

This follows the red phase of TDD perfectly. I've written tests that express what we want:
- Consistent naming patterns for different stream types
- Type-safe stream ID creation
- Unique stream IDs for different entities
- Consistent stream IDs for the same entity

Let me pass this to Niko Matsakis to help with the type system aspects of implementing the streams module.

## Round 3 - Niko Matsakis (Rust Type System Expert)

I see Kent has written good tests. After examining the existing type structure:
- SessionId exists in domain::session
- UserId exists in domain::user
- AnalysisId and ExtractionId don't exist yet

I need to:
1. Create the missing ID types
2. Implement the streams module

Let me first create the missing types, then pass to Edwin Brady to ensure we're following type-driven principles before implementing the streams module.

---

## Round 4 - Edwin Brady (Type-Driven Development Expert)

Before creating new code, let me consider the type design. We need AnalysisId and ExtractionId types that follow the same pattern as SessionId and UserId. These should be newtypes wrapping UUIDs with generation methods.

I've created `src/domain/identifiers.rs` with:
- Type-safe AnalysisId and ExtractionId newtypes
- Time-ordered UUID v7 generation (important for event sourcing)
- Proper derives for serialization and display
- Tests to verify uniqueness and time ordering

The types are now exposed through the domain module. Let me hand off to Greg Young to implement the streams module with proper event sourcing patterns.

## Round 5 - Greg Young (Event Sourcing Architect)

Good work on the identifier types. Now I'll implement the streams module that provides consistent stream naming patterns for EventCore. This is crucial for event sourcing - stream names are the primary key for event storage and retrieval:
