# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Union Square project.

ADRs are a lightweight way to document architectural decisions made throughout the project. They help future developers understand not just what decisions were made, but why they were made and what alternatives were considered.
