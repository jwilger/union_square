//! Example demonstrating multi-stream query patterns using EventCore projections
//!
//! This example shows how to use Union Square's projection system to efficiently
//! query session data across multiple event streams using materialized views.
//!
//! NOTE: This example is temporarily simplified while we complete the migration
//! from custom projection infrastructure to EventCore's native system.

//! This example demonstrates the EventCore projection system concepts
